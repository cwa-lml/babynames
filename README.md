babynames
=========

Small web application / infographic showing popularity of baby names chosen for Kiwi kids 2004 - 2012

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate how to use the following technologies to create a simple but engaging information visualisation using freely-available government data:

* Excel pivot tables
* Data transformed from Excel to JSON
* [Twitter Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/) (using [Initilizr](http://www.initializr.com/))
* Responsive web design
* [D3.js](http://d3js.org/)
* [xCharts.js](http://tenxer.github.com/xcharts/) (a charting layer on top of D3.js)
* [underscore.js](http://underscorejs.org/) (for templating of HTML partials)

The data originated from New Zealand's Department of Internal Affairs (DIA), and was obtained as an Excel spreadsheet via [data.govt.nz](http://data.govt.nz/dataset/show/764)

The results can be seen at [http://cwa-lml.github.com/babynames/](http://cwa-lml.github.com/babynames/) while more information about how this project was put together is to be found at [http://cwa-lml.github.com/babynames/about.html](http://cwa-lml.github.com/babynames/about.html).

The results should display suitably well on most devices, from portrait phones (e.g. iPhone) to large-scale desktop screens.
